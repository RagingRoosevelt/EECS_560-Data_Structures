## Discussion

I'm trying a new thing with my makefile.  This time I'm trying to use macros to do a bit better job.
I'm also trying to compile so that the output is compatible with ddd and gdb since previously I was
debugging all the segfaults by hand with cout statements and I got fed up dealing with that.
