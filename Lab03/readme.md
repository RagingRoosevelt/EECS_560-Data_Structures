## Discussion

The one thing I wish I did differently was to handle rehasing within the data structure rather than 
letting whatever uses the data structure handle it.  I think that it varries by application which 
way makes more sense but in this case, it would have been better for the data structure to be more 
self-contained.

I seemed to have missed an edge case that comes from 1) inserting a value, 2) inserting a different 
value that has a hash collision and is then inserted via probing, 3) removing the first value that 
got inserted 4) inserting the second value again.  In this case, the insert function should notice 
the "deleted" flag and keep hunting for the value rather than seeing that the location is empty and 
then inserting the duplicate value.

I've since fixed the issue mentioned in the previous paragraph.  The bug could be generated by, for 
instance, the following sequence of inserts and deletes:

1. insert 2 (causes probing later, also causes table to rehash on our terms)
2. insert 23 (has the same key as 12 since our prime is now 11)
3. insert 12 (collides with 23, has to probe to insert)
4. remove 23 (will set flag to true, this is where the program wasn't looking far enough)
5. insert 12 (program didn't notice flag where 23 was, didn't keep looking for 12)
